    * Tags in OSM objects are now stored as new type Tags, not Hash.
    * New to_xml methods to dump OSM objects or a Database to XML using the
      Builder Library.
    * A newly created OSMObject without an ID will now get a unique negative ID.
    * When an object is added to a Database and another object with the same
      ID is already in there, the old object will be cleanly removed from
      the database.
    * New methods OSMObject#[] and OSMObject#[]= to access tags directly.
    * Improved geometry support
    * Many more tests
    * Added magic << methods to Node, Way, and Relation classes
